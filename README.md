# Hand-Symbol-Recognition
Using Opencv and neural network training and detecting specific hand symbols 

How this works!
  There are two python file one for collecting training data and another for predicting the hand symbols. the training of the neural network is done in Teachable machines website by google
  
  On training code set your desired hand symbol file and press "s" to take a snap of your hand's image and it will save it in the file. use this images to create a neural network model in teachable machines website
  
  In the 2nd python file named detection Using the keras model provided by teachable machines predict the hand and overlay the prediction above the hand
